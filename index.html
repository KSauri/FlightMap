        <h3>Shortest Paths with the A* Algorithm</h3>
          <p>
            Imagine you're a computer. Clearly most of your time will be spent trying
            to figure out how to take over the world/finding true love, but in your
            free time you may need to find the shortest path between two points - but
            how?? Well, dear computer reader, you could use the A* path finding algorithm!
            But what is it? Let's use flight as an example (if skynet can, why not us?)
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, the algorithm begins at the starting airport, and will choose the
            best airport it can get to from there.  It does this by weighing A) the cost
            to get to each airport so far (from start that cost is 0), and B) when
            using distances, the distance each point it considers is from the destination.
            Then the algorithm will pick a new point. After that it starts the process over again,
            now with whatever places the new airport can fly to.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can witness this process in the visualization! The algorithm will pick
            a new airport and then pull in all connecting airports (unless they've
            been checked already).
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also a demonstration of "brute force" - where regardless of the
            path, every airport has to be checked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now you have the tools to path-find all you want!
